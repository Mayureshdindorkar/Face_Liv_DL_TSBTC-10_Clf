# Face Liveness Detection (Face Anti-spoofing):  

- Built an AI model that determines whether the face of the person sitting in front of the webcam is Real or Fake by using Transfer Learning and TSBTC (Thepadeâ€™s Sorted Bock Truncation Encoding).

- The model consistes of two parts:
    1. Feature extractor:  
        a. Deep learning based feature extractor: Finetuned VGG19  
        b. Handcrafted feature extractor        : TSBTC-10 ary (Thepade's Sorted Block Truncation Encoding)  
    3. Classifier:  
         Decision Tree    

- Created model is robust to Photo attack, video attack, warped photo attack, etc.
